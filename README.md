# 🤖 Kyubi Bot

Kyubi is a multifunctional and multiguild bot that tries to meet the needs of servers and the people who are on it with various commands that have been carefully chosen for moderation and fun for all users. It is worth mentioning that the original code that he created is in Spanish and that there are things to translate. I will update and include new functions and commands over time.
